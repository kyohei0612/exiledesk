// From-existing-item planner (Option 2). Transform an item you ALREADY hold into a target. The key
// difference from the from-white optimizer is the COST MODEL: `planExpectedCost` restarts to the
// STARTING item on a miss — you keep the good mods you began with (or reproduce that start), rather than
// binning it back to a blank base — so the plan never "throws away" the part you already have. It reaches
// EXACTLY the target: every current mod not in the target is junk to remove, every target mod not present
// must be added. Removal is a random Annulment (or the remove-half of a Chaos); adds are Exalts (into an
// open slot), the add-half of a Chaos, a Desecration (a desecrated mod, via its boss omen), or a Perfect
// Essence (which removes one random mod as it adds — a junk mod, or a THROWAWAY rolled right before it
// for exactly that). A MAGIC start is handled by opening with a Regal
// Orb, which converts to Rare while adding one mod — without that, the commonest starting point in the
// game (a magic base you are part-way through) had no planner at all. Everything runs at base orb
// strength; tier targets are honoured and per-exalt /
// per-perfect-essence side omens are explored.
