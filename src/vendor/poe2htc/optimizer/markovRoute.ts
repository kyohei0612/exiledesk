// pass that settles, for EVERY state, which action the policy plays, what that costs and where it
// lands (`RouteTable`). The graph is then a walk over that table from a chosen root (`routeFrom`) —
// the craft's own start for the result every tab shows, and any other state when the Lab is asked
// what finishing costs from an item you could buy instead.
//
// Plain data on purpose: the table rides the solve result across the worker boundary, which is a
// structured clone. Typed arrays and strings survive that; a closure over the solver's state would
// not, and keeping the solver alive in the worker instead would tie a route on screen to a worker
// that any later Cancel terminates. See `RouteTable`.

   * and the same cost, because they all share V(start). A real 6-target T2 craft drew ten boxes at
   * 90% coverage and nine of them said "Start over with a new base · 2,132 div". The part a player
   * needs — Chaos, Annul, Perfect Exalt, Desecrate, where the cost finally falls 2,131 → 751 — sat

   * `toGoal` fixes it by construction: a state whose best move is to restart has no non-restart edge

   * mix slowly). Measured 2026-09-11, converging it properly changes nothing a reader sees — across 40
   * of those routes the states drawn at 90% and at 99% coverage were identical, and no visit rate that
   * matters moved by more than 0.3% — while a Gauss-Seidel solve with self-loops divided out still
