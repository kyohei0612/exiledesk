// Choosing every step's orb strength and omen at once, without enumerating their product.
//
// THE PROBLEM. A plan's cost is `planExpectedCost`'s free-restart figure and its value is its success
// probability, and both move when you change any step's orb. With three strengths and an optional omen
// per step, a five-add plan has hundreds of assignments and a from-item search has thousands of plans;
// their product is the 71.9-million-plan search that made this axis look unaffordable.
//
// THE STRUCTURE THAT DISSOLVES IT. Rewrite `planExpectedCost`:
//
//     E = (Σ_k c_k · S_{k-1}) / S_n   where S_k = Π_{i≤k} p_i
//       = Σ_k c_k / T_k               where T_k = Π_{i≥k} p_i   (the SUFFIX product)
//
// so `T_k = p_k · T_{k+1}` and `E_k = E_{k+1} + c_k / T_k`. Both depend on the suffix alone. And the
// levers do not touch the state trajectory (see `levers.ts`), so step k's options are the same
// whatever was chosen after it. A backward pass over the steps therefore computes every Pareto-optimal
// assignment directly, and the search stops being a product and becomes a sum.
//
// WHY PRUNING IS EXACT, not a heuristic. Take two partial suffixes with `T_a ≥ T_b` and `E_a ≤ E_b` —
// `a` is at least as likely and no dearer. Extend both by the same option `(p, c)`:
//
//     T'_a = p·T_a ≥ p·T_b = T'_b        and        E'_a = E_a + c/(p·T_a) ≤ E_b + c/(p·T_b) = E'_b
//
// because `c ≥ 0` and `T_a ≥ T_b`. Domination survives every extension, so a dominated point can never
// come back — dropping it loses nothing. The output frontier is identical to brute force, and
// `leverDp.test.ts` checks that against an actual brute force rather than taking the algebra's word.
//
// The proof needs `c ≥ 0` and `p > 0`. `leverOptions` guarantees both.
//
// WHY THE FRONTIER STAYS SMALL. Subtracting the two extensions above:
//
//     E'_a − E'_b = (E_a − E_b) − (c/p)·(1/T_b − 1/T_a)
//
// The subtracted term is strictly positive whenever `c > 0`, so every step that costs anything erodes
// the gap between two incomparable points until one of them dies. Incomparability only survives where
// step costs are small next to the spread in E. That is a mechanism, not luck, and it is why
// `MAX_FRONTIER` has never been observed to bind.
