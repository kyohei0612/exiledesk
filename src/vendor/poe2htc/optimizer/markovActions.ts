   *
   * The redundancy is not a corner case; measured on real 0.5.0 crafts it is 23-31% of every action the
   * solver evaluates, from four independent causes:
   *
   *   • A SIDE OMEN that constrains nothing. `addOutcomes` uses `constrainTo` only to close the other
   *     side, so a Sinistral Exaltation is bit-identical to a plain one wherever the suffix side is
   *     already full — at 20-27x the price, since an omen costs that much more than the orb it wraps.
   *     (The opposite variant is already dropped by the empty-`dist` guard below, which is why it is
   *     the surviving one that duplicates.)
   *   • A STRENGTH that buys nothing. Greater/Perfect raise the minimum tier the roll can produce; on a
   *     high-ilvl base, or once the remaining addable mods all sit above the floor anyway, the
   *     distribution is unchanged and only the price moves.
   *   • A BOSS whose pool happens to be the whole legal pool — the case the desecrate block below has
   *     always noted, now acted on rather than merely tie-broken.
   *   • An OMEN OF LIGHT where the flagged mod is the only thing an Annulment could take, so making the
   *     removal certain makes no difference.
   *
   * Keeping the cheapest, first-pushed spelling reproduces today's policy EXACTLY rather than merely
   * costing the same: a strictly cheaper duplicate already had strictly lower value and already won the
   * argmin, and on equal cost the first survives, which is the order `bestAction`'s strict `<` already
   * resolved in. That is also the answer the player wants — the unomened action is pushed first
   * everywhere, so it is the one that survives: same odds, same cost, one fewer thing they must own.
   *
   * `isRestart` is part of the signature and MUST stay there. Phase A of the solve runs push-forward
   * only, so it skips restarts; an Annulment that empties a one-mod item lands on the start state with
   * P=1 exactly as a restart does, and folding those two together would leave phase A with no action at
   * all at that state — an Infinity where a real value belongs, and a different seed for phase B.
   *
   * The reroll is in it too: an Echoes-omened offer shares its plain twin's draw exactly and is worth
   * more, so should the two ever be offered side by side they are different moves.
