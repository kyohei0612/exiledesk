// actually get for it?" Returns the (closeness ↔ P(finish within budget)) Pareto frontier, mirroring
// the cost↔probability frontier optimize.ts already produces. Row 0 is the exact target you asked for
// (usually with a dismal P — that's the point), followed by the minimal relaxations that buy real odds.
//
// WHAT MAY BE RELAXED. Per desired slot: keep the mod but slide its tier requirement down, swap it for
// a SAME-FAMILY sibling, or drop it — with at most ONE slot swapped-or-dropped across the whole item
// ("1 different mod"). Pinned slots are frozen entirely.
//
// WHY NOT TAG-SIMILAR SWAPS (this is load-bearing — don't "improve" it back in): a tag-Jaccard metric
// over 0.5.0 scores "#% increased Light Radius" at 1.00 against "+# to maximum Mana", because both mods
// carry exactly ['resource','mana'] and nothing else. The tags simply don't hold the information, and
// the bad row would rank FIRST (it's cheap). Same-family siblings are a declared exclusion group, not
// an inferred similarity, so they can't produce that. Revisit only via tiers[].stats (`base_maximum_mana`
// vs `mana_regeneration_rate_+%`), which covers 77% of tiers.
//
// USELESS SWAPS FILTER THEMSELVES OUT. On Wands all 5 WeaponDamageTypePrefix siblings (Fire/Cold/
// Lightning/Phys/Chaos) carry identical weights, so Fire→Cold costs exactly the same: same P at lower
// closeness ⇒ dominated ⇒ never on the frontier. Whereas IncreaseSocketedGemLevel runs 500 (all Spell
// Skills) vs 2600 (Fire Spell Skills) — a 5.2× swing that surfaces. No special-casing needed either way.

 * The frontier plan likeliest to finish inside the budget — screening cheaply before settling.
 *
 * The CHEAPEST plan isn't automatically the likeliest to land inside the budget: a dearer, surer plan
 * can finish in budget more often, so the whole frontier has to be scanned rather than assumed about.
 *
 * Scanning it at full precision was **86% of a from-item alternatives run**, and almost all of that
 * went on proving that plans LOSE — `planCostCdf` costs ~7 ms per plan at the shipped cell cap, and
 * this ran on every row of every node: 1,447 sweeps across 200 nodes to report one winner each.
 * Screening first cut a real search 3.4-3.7x with byte-identical rows.
 *
 * WHY THE SKIP IS EXACT. `planCostCdf` returns a bracket AROUND the true value at any cell count. So
 * `settle(x).lower <= truth(x) <= screen(x).upper` for every plan, whatever the two grids are doing —
 * no nesting assumption, no tolerance. A plan whose screening ceiling sits below a rival's SETTLED
 * floor is therefore beaten outright, and skipping it cannot change the winner.
 *
 * The comparison is asymmetric on purpose, and that is the whole of the correctness argument: the
 * ceiling must come from the screen and the floor from a settled sweep. Pruning on the screen's own
 * `lower` would compare two bounds that do not bracket each other and could cut the true winner —
 * `alternatives.test.ts` injects a deliberately coarse screen to hold that down, because on real data
 * the screen is tight enough that the mistake is invisible.
 *
 * Best-first, so the likeliest winner sets a high floor immediately and the rest fall to it. Ties keep
 * the earlier frontier row, which is what the plain loop's strict `>` resolved to.
 *
 * The ONE thing `screen` must satisfy is `screen(x).upper >= truth(x)`. It may be arbitrarily loose
 * and may rank the frontier backwards — that costs extra settled sweeps and nothing else. A screen
 * that under-states the ceiling breaks the guarantee, which is why this takes a `CostCdfBounds` (a
 * bracket, by construction) rather than a number.
