// SLOTS — the one place that knows which targets are alternatives for each other.
//
// A target carries an optional `slot`. Candidates sharing a slot fill it interchangeably ("Extra Cold
// or Extra Lightning, I don't care which"), so a target list may name more candidates than the six mods
// an item holds. A target with no `slot` is a slot of its own, which is what every target meant before
// slots existed — so a caller that has never heard of them gets one slot per target and every helper
// here reduces to the identity it replaced.
//
// TWO CONSUMERS, AND THEY NEED OPPOSITE THINGS:
//
//   - The MDP (`markovFromItem`) needs `slotIndexGroups`, because it solves the disjunction DIRECTLY.
//     Its goal accepts any one member per slot, so a bad roll on the way to Cold that lands Lightning
//     is simply a finish. That is the whole value of a slot, and it is why the MDP must not be handed
//     an expansion.
//
//   - The linear planners (`optimizePareto`, `optimizeFromItem`, `alternatives`) need `expandSlots`,
//     because what they produce is a FIXED SEQUENCE. A route has to commit to a mod to name it in a
//     step, so a slot becomes one concrete route per member and the frontier carries them all. That is
//     honest for a route, and it also sidesteps the factorial: those planners permute their target
//     list, so nine candidates in one list would be 9! = 362,880 orderings against 6! = 720 for each
//     of three expansions.
//
// Expanding for the MDP would be WRONG, not merely slower: min(cost(Cold), cost(Lightning)) over
// separate solves throws away exactly the option value a slot buys.
//
// What the MDP then does with a slot's members — merge the same-family ones into a single bit, and
// stop distinguishing interchangeable cross-family ones — lives in markovSymmetry.ts. That is a
// SOLVER optimisation and deliberately not here: it changes how a craft is represented, never which
// candidates are alternatives, and the linear planners must not see any of it.

/**
 * FREE SLOTS — positions on the finished item whose contents are not checked.
 *
 * "Three prefixes I want, and I don't care what the last suffix is." A free slot may hold any mod or
 * nothing at all, which is the whole difference from a slot with alternatives: alternatives enumerate
 * what would satisfy you, a free slot says nothing has to.
 *
 * It is a COUNT PER SIDE and never a target, and that distinction is the reason this feature is cheap.
 * A candidate costs a bit in `present`/`blocked` and doubles the lattice; the junk counters `jp`/`js`
 * are already state axes that `enumerateStates` fills in, so a free slot adds no states at all — it
 * only widens the accepting set, which makes the solve easier rather than harder. Naming every mod
 * that would do instead costs the opposite: nine candidates is ~20,952 states against ~2,916 at six,
 * and `MAX_CANDIDATES` refuses past that.
 *
 * Nothing else about the craft changes. `blocked` still has to be empty (see `isAccepting`), the side
 * caps still bound what an item can hold, and a free slot the side has no room for is simply
 * unreachable — `enumerateStates` never emits the state, so no caller has to check for it.
