 * plan's costs (see `exactQuantum`), which leaves nothing to round — hence `exact: true` and
 * lower === upper. Only incommensurable prices (or a budget/quantum ratio past `maxCells`) fall back
 * to a uniform grid; there, rounding every cost DOWN makes the plan look cheaper and yields an UPPER
 * bound while rounding UP yields a LOWER bound, so the pair still brackets the truth rather than
 * hiding the error.
 *
 * Evaluating at cell floor(budget/h) is not a truncation: every reachable total cost is a sum of
 * atoms, hence a multiple of h, so no attainable cost hides in (floor(budget/h)·h, budget].
