// From-item cost as a Markov Decision Process (the honest model). The linear from-item planner
// (fromItem.ts) assumes "restart to your item, free" on any miss — a fiction: a real annul removes a
// UNIFORMLY-RANDOM mod, so a miss leaves you in a WORSE state you recover from in place, and reproducing
// an expensive item is never free. Here we model the actual stochastic process: a policy over item
// states, transitions from the real pool weights, solved by value iteration for the minimum expected
// cost + the optimal policy. "Push forward" — never restart; the policy digs out of a bricked state.
//
// This file is the ORCHESTRATION: resolve the targets, enumerate the lattice, run value iteration, and
// walk the optimal policy into a graph. The two halves it stands on live next door —
//   • markovState.ts   — what a state IS (the present/blocked/junk abstraction) and how to key it
//   • markovActions.ts — what you can DO from a state, what it costs, and where it lands you
//
// v2 SCOPE (was v1: rollable normal targets, base orbs, exalt/annul/side-annul/chaos):
//   • v2a — family-aware tiered states: a below-tier roll BLOCKS the family; an item that already
//     carries a target at too low a tier starts BLOCKED, not satisfied. (Untiered targets have no
//     below-tier band, so this reduces exactly to the v1 present/absent model.)
//   • v2b — richer action set: Exalted Orb at base/Greater/Perfect strength and side-constrained
//     exalts. See markovActions.ts for the price-gating rule.
//
// DOCUMENTED APPROXIMATIONS: two target mods sharing a family are validated out upstream (so free
// targets always have distinct families); a fractured JUNK mod is treated as ordinary removable junk
// (only target mods can be fractured-locked here). Omen of Whittling — a CHAOS omen that changes the
// item's lowest-TIER mod (per-mod T-number, not ilvl) rather than a random one — needs the mod-tier
// ORDERING the abstraction discards, so it's out of scope. Perfect-essence / desecrate / essence
// targets stay on the linear planner (the caller falls back).

  // i.e. V0 is excessive. Phase B's sweeps therefore DESCEND toward V* instead of climbing, and two
  // things follow. Every iterate stays above V*, so a truncated phase B reports "at most x" (see
  // `bound`) rather than the "at least x" a 0-init solve gives. And — the reason this is the fix and
  // not an optimisation — the greedy policy is sensible from the very first sweep: restart wins at a
  // state only where `restartCost + V[start]` genuinely beats digging out, so a state holding a target
  // keeps it, and the extracted route reaches the goal even when the solve stops early.
  /**
   * How close is close enough — a thousandth of the cheapest thing the craft can do.
   *
   * A craft with a free action (a missing price mints one — see CLAUDE.md) has no positive `cheapest`
   * to scale from, so it keeps the old flat default. Slow, but never wrong.
   *
   * There WAS a second half here: phase B is an upper bound because phase A reached a fixed point, and
   * stopping phase A at residual `tol` weakens that, so the seed was scaled by
   * `cheapest / (cheapest − tol)` to put it back on the excessive side. The derivation is sound
   * (`T(cV) <= c·T(V)` for `c >= 1` with positive costs) and the code was one line — and it did
   * nothing measurable. Removing it moved the answer in the FIFTH decimal at every tolerance from 1e-4
   * to 1.5e-1, in both directions, and never turned a violated bound into a satisfied one.
   *
   * The reason is that phase B's own truncation dwarfs the seed's shortfall: a descending sequence
   * stopping at Δ < tol still sits tol/(1−r) above its limit with r near 1, which is orders larger than
   * the seed could be low by. What actually holds the bound up is that margin, and it is measured, not
   * assumed — see "never quotes an upper bound below the converged cost". Keeping an unfalsifiable line
   * whose comment claimed to guarantee something it did not is worse than saying plainly what does.

   * What the player keeps when an action shows several draws and they must take one.
   *
   * A Desecration offers three modifiers and you choose — so its value is not `Σ p·V` over one draw
   * but `E[min over the offer]`, which depends on V and cannot be folded into the distribution ahead
   * of time. Sort the outcomes by V ascending and let `T_k` be the tail sum from k. The player keeps
   * outcome k exactly when every draw landed in `{k…K}` but not all in `{k+1…K}`, so
   *
   *     P(keep k) = T_k^m − T_(k+1)^m       (m = offers shown)
   *
   * With m = 1 this collapses to `T_k − T_(k+1) = p_k`, i.e. the ordinary expectation — the identity
   * is one formula, not a special case bolted on. O(K log K) with K ≈ 10 outcomes, and only a
   * Desecration pays it.
   *
   * With a REROLL — an Omen of Abyssal Echoes, spent only when used (confirmed 2026-09-10) — the player
   * sees the first offer and may pay the omen to throw all of it back for a fresh one, which they must
   * then keep; the fresh three may repeat mods from the first. They throw it back exactly when its best
   * is worse than the omen plus a fresh offer: c + τ, with τ = Σ P(keep k)·V_k the plain value above.
   * So outcome k is kept from the first offer when V_k ≤ c + τ, and from the second whenever the first
   * went back:
   *
   *     P'(keep k) = [V_k ≤ c + τ]·P(keep k) + P(throw)·P(keep k),   P(throw) = Σ over V_j > c + τ of P(keep j)
   *
   * The weights still sum to one; the value adds the omen's expected spend, P(throw)·c, and leaves
   * P(throw) in `lastThrow` for the callers that need the spend on its own.
   *
   * Fills `w` with the probability of ending on each outcome, indexed like `a.to`, and returns Σ w·V —
   * the action's value less its cost. `offerValue`, the closed-form evaluation and the published edges
   * all read it, so the three cannot disagree about what an offer is worth.
   *
   * The sort starts from the order the last call left: V moves little from one sweep to the next, so
   * insertion sort is close to linear. The value does not depend on how outcomes tied on V are ordered;
   * their individual weights do, so a caller that PUBLISHES or FREEZES the weights passes `fromStart`,
   * and ties split by index every time rather than by the history of the solve.

   * Cost a FIXED policy exactly, in closed form, instead of iterating a chain that barely contracts.
   *
   * Iterative evaluation is where policy iteration spends essentially all its time, and it is slow for
   * a structural reason: with a free base ~98% of states choose restart, so `V(s) = restartCost +
   * V(start)` almost everywhere and the chain's contraction rate sits at r ≈ 1. A residual under `tol`
   * still leaves an error of `tol/(1−r)`, and `1/(1−r)` is the expected number of attempts — thousands.
   * Measured: varying only the evaluation tolerance moved one craft 74.4s → 0.8s and its answer
   * 4,753 → 35,417, a 93x speed span with accuracy tracking it exactly. So there is no cheap win to be
   * had by loosening a number.
   *
   * The way out is to stop iterating the loop at all. Under a fixed policy an attempt either reaches
   * the goal or hits a state where the policy restarts — and restarting begins an identical attempt.
   * That is a renewal process, so on the restart-ABSORBING chain (restart is a terminal payment, not
   * an edge back to the start) define
   *
   *     c(s) = expected cost from s until goal-or-restart      c(goal)=0, c(restart)=restartCost
   *     q(s) = P(restart before goal, from s)                  q(goal)=0, q(restart)=1
   *
   * and then, exactly:
   *
   *     V(start) = c(start) / (1 − q(start))        ← renewal-reward, one division
   *     V(s)     = c(s) + q(s)·V(start)             ← one pass
   *
   * The near-1 contraction is gone because the cycle causing it is gone. Better still, restart states
   * are TERMINAL here — and they are 98% of the lattice — so the chain c and q actually propagate
   * through is the thin spine of states the craft passes through, not the whole space.
   *
   * OFFER ACTIONS are the wrinkle. `offerValue` sorts a Desecration's three draws by current V, so its
   * realized distribution moves as V moves, which would make c and q non-linear. The ordering is
   * therefore FROZEN for the duration of one evaluation — treated as part of the policy, exactly as
   * the improvement step already treats the choice of action. Improvement re-orders next round.
   * An Echoes reroll's keep-or-throw-back decision is frozen with it: it reads the same V.
   *
   * Returns false when the policy never reaches the goal (`q(start) = 1`), which is a real state of
   * affairs — an improper policy has infinite value — and the caller must not read V after it.

   * Phase B ONLY, and deliberately. PI on a stochastic shortest path is only safe from a PROPER policy

   * diverges. Phase B is seeded from phase A's converged value, which IS a proper policy's value, so
