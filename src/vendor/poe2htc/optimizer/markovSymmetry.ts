// SYMMETRY — when two of a slot's alternatives are indistinguishable to the solver, and what to do
// about it.
//
// A slot's candidates are interchangeable by definition of the feature: the player said "either will
// do". The solver does not know that, so it spends a bit on each and carries a state for every
// arrangement of them. Most of those states are the same situation wearing different labels, and the
// lattice is the dominant cost of a solve.
//
// There are TWO cases and they need opposite treatments, because they differ in whether the members
// can be on the item AT THE SAME TIME:
//
//   - SAME FAMILY (`#% increased Fire / Cold / Lightning Damage` are one family,
//     `WeaponDamageTypePrefix`). Only one can ever land. Once any of them does, the whole family is
//     excluded, so every later draw sees the identical pool and a removal returns the slot to empty
//     either way. Nothing downstream can tell them apart — so they MERGE into one target holding one
//     bit, and their weights sum on arrival. Exact, and unconditional: individual weights and tier
//     floors stop mattering the moment the family is occupied, and on arrival they simply add up.
//
//   - CROSS FAMILY (`Gain % as Extra Cold / Lightning` are `ColdDamage` / `LightningDamage`). Both can
//     sit on the item at once, and the family each occupies is different, so they cannot merge: the
//     pool denominator would be wrong and the "you got both" state — which is a finished item — would
//     have nowhere to go. What CAN go is the labelling. If the two are interchangeable in the stricter
//     sense below, `(Cold present, Lightning blocked)` and `(Cold blocked, Lightning present)` are one
//     situation, and the state key is canonicalised so only one of them is ever built.
//
// The stricter sense is real and checkable rather than assumed, because cross-family members are only
// interchangeable when the DATA says so — same weights at every reachable floor, and families whose
// exclusion removes the same weight from every pool. `Wands/DamageGainedAsCold`, `…AsFire` and
// `…AsLightning` all satisfy it today — sole members of their families, identical tier tables. Ask
// different TIERS of them and they stop, which is much the commonest way this does not apply.

 * The two unique cases are the ones that look mergeable and are not:
