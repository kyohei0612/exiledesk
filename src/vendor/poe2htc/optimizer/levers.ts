// The knobs on a crafting step that change only its ODDS and its PRICE — never what happens next.
//
// A plan step names an outcome ("Exalt, landing Increased Mana"). Around that outcome sit choices the
// player makes at the counter: which strength of orb to buy, whether to spend an omen alongside it.
// They move the probability and the bill, and they move nothing else — `applyStep` (plan.ts) reads
// only `currency` / `remove` / `add` / `adds` / `essenceTier`, so the item that comes out the other
// side is the same item whichever way they are set.
//
// That is the whole reason this module exists as its own thing. Because the levers do not touch the
// state trajectory, a search does NOT have to enumerate their product across a plan: it can price them
// one step at a time against a state it already knows, and combine the results afterwards
// (`leverDp.ts`). A five-add plan has 3^5 orb assignments; it has 5 x 3 lever options.
//
// The property is a fact about today's `applyStep`, not a law, so `levers.test.ts` asserts it directly
// — every option this module returns must leave the same item behind as the step it came from. A
// future lever that changed the outcome (an Omen of Greater Exaltation adds TWO mods) would turn that
// test red instead of quietly corrupting a frontier.

/**
 * Every way `step` can be bought against `state`, minus the ways that can never win.
 *
 * Returned in a deliberate order — base strength before greater before perfect, omen off before on —
 * so that when two options tie exactly, the one kept is the cheaper, plainer orb. A route that reads
 * "Perfect Exalt" where a plain one buys the same odds is a route the player would rightly distrust.
 *
 * Three filters, in the order that costs least:
 *
 *  1. A strength the sheet does not list is SKIPPED, never priced at the base key. `stepCost` charges
 *     0 for a missing key, so an unlisted Perfect orb would come back FREE and dominate everything it
 *     touched — the exact trap `cost.test.ts` pins. Mirrors `markovActions.ts`, which gates its own
 *     strengths on `prices.currency[key] !== undefined` for the same reason.
 *  2. `allowsStep` — the same function the frontier filters with, so what the search prunes and what
 *     the player is promised can never drift apart.
 *  3. `prob <= 0` drops. This is the ONLY legality check the module needs, and it is exact: an orb
 *     whose ilvl floor puts the target out of reach, an omen pointing at the wrong side, a
 *     side-constrained add onto a full side all score 0 on their own. It is also why this must not
 *     reuse `legalOrbTiers` (optimize.ts), which answers the same question by arithmetic on the
 *     target's MINIMUM tier and gets it wrong for an any-tier target: `tiers[0].ilvl` is about 1, every
 *     strength floor is above it, and the function concludes `['base']` — while a Greater orb is
 *     perfectly legal there, since a better tier still satisfies "any tier or better". That planner
 *     needs the guess because it builds its cross product before it knows any probability. This one
 *     computes the probability first, so it can simply look.
 * What this deliberately does NOT do is drop options one another dominates. That is the search's
 * business (`leverDp.ts` prunes them before its first pass), and keeping it there has two payoffs: the
 * count of what was offered stays available for the "plans checked" figure, and the brute-force
 * differential enumerates the unpruned set, so it tests the domination rule instead of sharing it.
