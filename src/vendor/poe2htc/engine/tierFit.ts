 * Which tier produced a roll — the one place that decides it.
 *
 * Two resolvers need this answer and must never disagree about it: `resolveMods` reads the printed
 * text a player pastes, and `statLookup` reads the structured stat values a profile API serves. They
 * differ entirely in how they find the MOD and not at all in how they pin the TIER, so the tier half
 * lives here rather than being written twice. Two copies of "did this roll come from this tier" is
 * exactly the shape of the D8 pricing bug: one mechanic, two implementations, quietly diverging.
 */

/**
 * Is a value inside a tier's range?
 *
 * A "reduced" mod stores its range NEGATIVE — `#% reduced Attribute Requirements` keeps `[-35,-35]` —
 * and the two readers meet it with opposite signs: pasted text prints the magnitude (`35`; the wording
 * carries the sign), while a profile API sends the signed stat value (`-35`). So a negative range is
 * judged by MAGNITUDE, which reads both, as `aboveEveryTier` below always did. This used to flip the
 * sign unconditionally — right for text, wrong for stats — so the gear reader could place none of the
 * 52 shipped "reduced" mods, while pasting the same item read them fine.
 *
 * A positive range compares raw. No shipped range spans zero, so the two cases never meet.

 * about READING: a roll over the top is at least the best tier, so that is what it reports.

 * claims: a roll can fit no tier by being too small, by being read as the wrong mod, or by two
 * printed lines having been grouped as one modifier they are not. Only "at or above the top, and
