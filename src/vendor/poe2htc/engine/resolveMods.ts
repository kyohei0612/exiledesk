/**
 * "Which mod is this line?" — the printed text on an item -> a mod id and tier in the pools.
 *
 * An item read from anywhere outside this app — a Ctrl+C paste, a poe.ninja profile — arrives as
 * rendered English: `+42% of Armour also applies to Elemental Damage`. The engine needs
 * `Helmets_str/ArmourAppliesToElementalDamage` at tier `of Furring`, because a mod id is what the
 * pools, the weights and every probability are keyed by. This is the bridge, and it is the only
 * place that knows how a mod's stored template relates to what the game prints.
 *
 * SCOPED TO ONE BASE, which is what makes it tractable. `+#% to Cold Resistance` is 64 different
 * mods across the shipped data — one per base, plus the essence twin — and a global text index would
 * be ambiguous on nearly every line. Inside a single base's pools it is at most a handful, and the
 * rolled values usually settle the rest.
 *
 * AMBIGUITY IS REPORTED, NOT GUESSED, exactly as `baseLookup` reports it: `modIds` names every
 * candidate and `modId` is set only when one survives. A caller that silently took the first would
 * plan against the wrong tier weights, and the numbers it printed would be wrong in a way nothing
 * on screen could reveal.
 *
 * IT RESOLVES ONLY WHAT THE POOLS CONTAIN. Runes, enchants and corruption implicits are not craftable
 * and are not in any pool, so they land in `unresolved` — which is the correct answer for them, not a
 * failure. A caller must not feed them to the planner as targets: no orb can produce them.
