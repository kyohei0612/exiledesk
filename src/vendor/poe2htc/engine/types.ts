// `group`/`field` are the RePoE provenance `dataIntegrity.test.ts` checks the import against, and
// `stats` is the named route to cross-family similarity (see alternatives.ts). They are gone from
// this type, which is now the app's contract: `shipMods.ts` projects the file onto exactly these
// fields for the browser, so anything this type does not declare is not in the asset the app loads.
