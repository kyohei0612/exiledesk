/**
 * "Which mod is this?" — answered from STAT KEYS rather than from printed text.
 *
 * A profile API serves an item's modifiers structurally: each one carries the game's own stat
 * identifiers and their rolled values (`{ "additional_intelligence": 35 }`). That is a far better key
 * than the rendered English `resolveMods` has to work from, and it sidesteps every hard case that one
 * has:
 *
 *   - no markup to strip, and nothing language-dependent;
 *   - a modifier printing across two lines is already one entry, so there is no window to guess;
 *   - and, decisively, TWO MODIFIERS THAT PRINT AS ONE LINE arrive as two entries. The game sums
 *     same-stat modifiers on screen — a staff carrying 71% and 62% "Gain as Extra Fire" displays a
 *     single `133%` — and no reader of the text can undo that. Here they never merged.
 *
 * Measured across the shipped data: a mod's stat SET identifies it uniquely within a base except in
 * 8 cases over 52 bases, all of them the `increased Rarity of Items found` prefix/suffix pair that is
 * equally ambiguous from text. So this is not merely tidier, it is more determined.
 *
 * IT NEEDS THE FULL MODS FILE, which is the one real constraint. `tiers[].stats` is deliberately
 * stripped from the asset the browser downloads (`shipMods.ts` projects onto exactly what `Mod`
 * declares), so a `PatchData` built in the browser carries no stats and `statIndex` will find
 * nothing. That is fine for the job this exists for — reading profiles in a periodic task, the way
 * prices are refreshed — and it is why this must not be wired into a browser path without shipping
 * `stats` first, which was measured and deliberately declined.

   * candidates it is decisive, because the disagreements are in spelling rather than in meaning:
   * `ItemFoundRarityIncreasePrefix3` names the prefix outright, and that is precisely the pair no
   * amount of reading the roll can tell apart. It settled 5 of 5 such cases and can settle nothing
