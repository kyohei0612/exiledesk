/**
 * The socketables that change what a CRAFT can produce.
 *
 * Runes of Aldur (0.5) added Ancient Runes and the element-converting Aldur runes. A scan of all 313
 * socketables in the game data (RePoE `augments.json`, 2026-09-15) found these twelve to be the ones
 * whose effect is about an item's MODIFIERS. Everything else there acts on the character, or on
 * something this app does not model, and is deliberately absent:
 *
 *   - Atziri's Soul Cores of Devotion / Vitality / Alacrity / Inoculation — "Corrupting will always
 *     result in change", and corruption is not modelled;
 *   - Cadigan's Epiphany — destroys the augment sockets to make a jewel socket;
 *   - Legacy of Runeseeker's Call — socketed runes are 75% stronger, which changes rune values rather
 *     than craft rules.
 *
 * Each rune is SOCKETED rather than spent, so it also costs a socket; Dorian confirmed (2026-09-15)
 * that an item keeps what the rune allowed after the rune is swapped out, which is why a plan may end
 * by replacing it.
